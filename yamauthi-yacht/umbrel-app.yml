  Easy to Use
    Yacht was designed from the ground up to be easily installed and used to get your website up and running quickly.
  Focus on What Matters
    Yacht lets you focus on what apps you want to run instead of worrying about how to deploy them.
  Compose Support Out of The Box
    Managing large docker projects has never been easier. Import compose projects you're already using or write new ones easily using the built in editor.

  Post Installation
  Templating: Currently Yacht is compatible with portainer templates. You'll add a template url in the "Add Template" settings. The the template will be read, separated into apps, and imported into the database. The apps associated with the templates are linked via a db relationship so when the template is removed, so are the apps associated with it. We store the template url as well so we can enable updating templates with a button press.
  We recommend starting with: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SelfhostedPro/selfhosted_templates/yacht/Template/template.json
  
  Note: Apps deployed on Yacht will not appear on the UmbrelOS system.
